Hello World!

My name is David and I enjoy creating programs and collaborating with people to work towards common, unique and creative goals. My pastimes include watching lots of educational YouTube videos, yes I know it sounds nerdy, hanging out with friends and learning new things (I'm currently working on learning piano). Anyways I'm new to this GitHub thing but so far it's been pretty simple to use and the tutorials that I've found on the guides page have proven to be resourceful and efficient. So that's a little bit about me and what I'm working on right now.

P.S. To whoever is reading this....

HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY!
